# [Advanced OOP in PHP With Tests][published url]
## Instructor: [Patkos Csaba][instructor url]

Welcome to the second part of [OOP in PHP With Tests](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/oop-in-php-with-tests). In this course we will continue where we left off previously and we will start programming at a faster pace. We will consider architecture problems and use test-driven development to devise solutions for problems like object creation and persistence.

Each lesson will take the source code one step closer to our goal. We will define the requirements for this course project in a planning session when we will define the tasks we need to do and we will track those tasks through a kanban-style planning board. This will let us follow our progress through the course.
